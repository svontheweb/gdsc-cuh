            <p><strong>Developer Student Clubs (GDSC)</strong> are university based community groups for students
                interested in Google developer technologies. With clubs hosted in 110+ countries around the world,
                students from undergraduate and graduate programs with an interest in leading a community are welcome.
                Together, students learn <em>the latest in Machine Learning, Android App Development, Google Cloud
                    Platform, Flutter, and so much more.</em>
            <p>By joining a GDSC, students grow their knowledge in a <em>peer-to-peer learning environment</em> and put
                theory to practice by <em>building solutions for local businesses and their community.</em></p>
